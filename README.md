## C# Live Project

## CampSite Web App

## Django Checkbook
This application created using Django tracks faux bank accounts. Users can create new accounts, enter transancations, and view their balance sheets.

## Explore the PNW Site
This one-page website was built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used a faux-adventure company as the theme, and included my own pictures taken in the Pacific northwest. The page includes an interactive lightbox slideshow, embeded videos, and navigation links.

## St. Phoenix Site
This one-page website was built using bootstrap 4. It includes a jumbotron, cards, badges, and a pop-up form among other things. I used a tropical island resort named after my dog Phoenix as the theme.
